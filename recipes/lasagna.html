        <li>tomato paste</li>
        <li>sugar</li>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion and garlic in oven over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomatoe paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tbsp parsley, basil, 1 tsp salt, italian seasoning, fennel seeds and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <br></br
        <li> Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tbsp parsley, and 1/2 tsp salt.</li><br></br>
        <li>Preheat oven to 376 degrees F(190 degrees C).</li><br></br>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the riccota cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil or make sure foil does not touch the cheese.</li><br></br>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. Rest lasgna for 15 minutes before serving.</li><br></br>
